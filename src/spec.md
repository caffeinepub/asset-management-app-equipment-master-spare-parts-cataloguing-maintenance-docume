# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebuild and publish a fresh, non-expired draft deployment of the current Maintenance Hub codebase.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate a new draft build from the current repository state.
- Publish the draft environment to a fresh draft URL (not expired at delivery).
- Make no changes to application functionality, features, or UI behavior as part of the rebuild.

**User-visible outcome:** The user can open and use Maintenance Hub via a new draft URL that is active and not expired.
