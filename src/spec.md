# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Document the current admin role implementation in both backend and frontend code.

**Planned changes:**
- Display the admin role logic from backend/main.mo showing how user roles are determined and which principals have admin access
- Display the frontend admin role checking logic in CataloguingPage showing how admin-only features (attribute template import interface) are conditionally rendered
- Document the authorization mechanism connecting backend role checks to frontend UI visibility

**User-visible outcome:** The current implementation of admin role checking will be clearly documented, showing how the system determines admin access and controls visibility of admin-only features like the attribute template import interface.
