  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements by adding comprehensive documentation and code comments that display the admin role implementation in both backend and frontend code. The backend shows admin role checking through the getAdminRole query function, and the frontend demonstrates conditional rendering based on admin status using the useIsCallerAdmin hook with detailed inline documentation.",
