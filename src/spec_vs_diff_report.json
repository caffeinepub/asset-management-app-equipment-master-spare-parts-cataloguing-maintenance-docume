  "summary": "The diff shows comprehensive implementation of all requirements (REQ-19 through REQ-22). Backend parsing methods, state storage, frontend dynamic rendering, and component integration are all present. However, the backend implementation is truncated, making it impossible to verify complete parsing logic and validation rule extraction.",

      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Parse the uploaded Excel file to extract attribute definitions including validation rules and metadata",
      "reason": "Backend main.mo is truncated before attribute parsing implementation is shown. Cannot verify if Excel parsing extracts validation rules or metadata fields beyond name and type.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",

      "reason": "Truncated backend code prevents verification of error handling during Excel parsing. Frontend shows toast.error handling, but backend trap messages for parsing errors are not visible.",
