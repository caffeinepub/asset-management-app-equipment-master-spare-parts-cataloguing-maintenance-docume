  "summary": "Diff adds frontend edit/delete UI controls across Equipment, Spare Parts, Maintenance, Cataloguing, and Documents pages, introduces a reusable ConfirmDialog, and extends React Query hooks with update/delete mutations and invalidations. Backend main.mo is modified but the provided snippet is truncated before any new update/delete methods can be confirmed.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added URL parameter/sessionStorage utilities for persisting and clearing URL parameters (including hash-routing support), which are not part of the requested edit/delete asset management functionality.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not mention adding URL parameter parsing/persistence utilities; it focuses on CRUD mutations and UI controls for asset records.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/utils/urlParams.ts"

    },
    {
      "description": "Actor initialization flow now reads a secret admin token from URL parameters and calls a backend access-control initialization method, plus it invalidates/refetches nearly all React Query queries when the actor changes.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest constraints/non-goals do not request admin-token URL handling or broad query invalidation/refetch behavior tied to actor recreation; the request is specifically about adding edit/delete operations and targeted invalidation for affected lists.",
